Investigating whether this approach can be applied as a general preprocessing technique to improve the accuracy of various time series classification methods
The repository only includes the evaluation on few TSC models now, with new experiments on newly-proposed TSC models to be performed in the near future.
the_log.txt contains the real-time performance of the nerual networks during the training process, while the value of each loss and the weight for them are recorded in log.txt .
